# ERDesigns-Electron-Vue-Vite-Pinia

This is a private application that im using at home and at work. It has several futures like a Calendar, Youtube Music Player, Developer Tools, Home Automation (Philips HUE, Logitech Hub, Yamaha MusicCast), among alot of other tools. This is a continious project that helps me sharpen my skills, evaluate code, and experiment new things.
